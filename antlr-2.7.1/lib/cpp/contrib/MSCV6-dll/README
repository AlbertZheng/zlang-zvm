Subject: Visual C++ 6.0 projects for ANTLR C++ generation. 

I've attached a ZIP file containing the alterations needed to make ANTLR
2.6.1 compile with Visual C++ 6.0 as both a static library and as a DLL.
Here is a summary of the changes I had to make:

- Config.hpp had some code added to define a macro called DLLEXPORT.  This
macro is defined as blank unless a macro called ANTLRDLL is defined
(presumably on the command line).  This makes it compatible with non-DLL
compilations and non-MSVC compilers.

- The remaining .hpp files have been altered to include the DLLEXPORT macro
after all uses of the class keyword.  For non-DLL/non-MSVC compilations
this will have no impact.  For a DLL compilation this will export the
symbols for use by other projects.

- A new (trivial) source file, DLL.CPP, has been added to the cpp
directory.

- The project files ANTLR.dsw, LIB.dsp and DLL.dsp have been added to the
cpp directory.

None of the .cpp files have been altered.

The project generates two DLLs and four LIBs:
- ANTLR.dll: release mode DLL
- ANTLR.lib: release mode DLL import library
- ANTLRd.dll: debug mode DLL
- ANTLRd.lib: debug mode DLL import library
- ANTLRs.lib: release mode static library
- ANTLRsd.lib: debug mode static library
